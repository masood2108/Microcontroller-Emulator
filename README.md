# Microcontroller Emulator with Task Scheduling

ðŸ“‹ **Project Description:**
This project is a software-based **Microcontroller Emulator** that simulates task scheduling, multi-threading, and real-time operating system (RTOS) behavior. It emulates how a microcontroller manages multiple tasks using different scheduling algorithms. The emulator provides an intuitive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for visualizing task execution, CPU usage, and context switching, making it easier to understand the principles of embedded systems and RTOS scheduling.

ðŸš€ **Features:**

### **Task Scheduling Algorithms:**
- **Round Robin Scheduling**: 
  - Tasks are executed in a time-slice manner, where each task gets an equal share of CPU time.
- **Priority Scheduling**: 
  - Tasks are executed based on their priority levels, ensuring high-priority tasks are completed first.

### **RTOS Simulation:**
- **Task States**: 
  - Manage tasks with states such as ready, running, and waiting.
- **Context Switching**: 
  - Simulate how tasks switch during execution, just like in real microcontrollers.
- **Message Queue**: 
  - Simple inter-task communication using message passing.

### **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
- **Task Management**: 
  - Add tasks dynamically with execution time and priority.
- **Scheduling Visualization**: 
  - Observe real-time task execution, CPU usage, and task switching.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: 
  - Monitor task progress, execution order, and performance.
